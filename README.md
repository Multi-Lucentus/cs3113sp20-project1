<b><u>Running the Program</u></b>
To run the program, simply type "make all" in the command line and it will compile to an executable file named "project1".</br>
From there, the user can just type "./project1 <[filename]" to run the program. [filename] should be replaced with the name of the file with the instructions for the program.
